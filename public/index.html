    <!-- Our script is a tiny piece of js, and if you notice there are no errors loading this page.
         Errors come from the file that is compiled and brought across, and they don't seem to be
         fixed by anything in this file. However they are fixed by having everything in the file that
         comes across, which happens when it has been compiled with optimizations being advanced.
         Okay - a little bit of html is returned - that's where I need to put these references!
