# fiddle
For quickly trying out re-com components esp the layout managers

Taken from here: http://nbeloglazov.com/2014/08/16/poor-mans-cljsfiddle.html

Start the Server with:

lein run

Then browse to:

http://localhost:8080

You should see a page with two panels. Enter cljs code on the left and press [Send]. Wait a while and the page layout should appear in the RHS panel. To it see working use the example code from YOUR_ROOT\fiddle\examples\append_button_code.txt. I just tested it and a button appeared in the RHS panel!
